## üóÉÔ∏è Archival Notice

This repository has been archived. Original Taskman-CLI was in a separate repository than the Taskman-CLI-PyPi package, just as an exercise to get comfortable with packaging. I have gotten enough experience now and will be working exclusively on the Taskman-CLI-PyPi repository. As such this repository won't be updated anymore and any further development will take place in the repository Taskman-CLI-PyPi.

You are welcome to check the [Taskman-CLI-PyPi](https://github.com/tahadnan/TaskMan-CLI-PyPi) repository for further improvements and releases.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**(P.S: I'm using Linux, so some commands may differ slightly. Please take this into consideration.)**
